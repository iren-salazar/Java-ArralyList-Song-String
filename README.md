A whole new world [Every turn a surprise] With new horizons to pursue [Every moment, red-letter] I'll chase them anywhere There's time to spare Let me share this whole new world with you A whole new world [A whole new world] That's where we'll be [That's where we'll be] A thrilling chase A wondrous place For you and me
